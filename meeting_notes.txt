# Meeting notes - 2020-07-22

Compare different methods for inferring functional connectivity from spike data.

What does a measure of functional connectivity look like?
    - doesn't have to be binary,
    - could be a continuum.

Uncertainty in statistical estimators.
    - noisy finite input data.
    - confidence interval.

pressure chamber for worm :)

model selection problem: find right bin size.
    maximum latency
    resolution: bin size
    loops
    osolations

different analysis for spike trains vs. firing rates

* spike time cross-correlation
    - distribution of point processes / poisson
    - actual observation are spikes

- For GLM (spikes or rates matter)
    + poisson likelihood
    + issue -> have to estimate firing rate from spikes

information in spikes that is not in the firing rates?

output: measure of statistical dependency

## Action points

* spikes vs. rates?

* cross-correlation analysis
* GLM

how are you going to do the statistics for this?
    - null hypothesis?
    - confidence intervals?

how to compare these different methods?

make a toy model where you know ground truth.
    - check that you get reasonable data
    - there is a true functional connectivity (function of the distribution)
    - product of the activity of the network.

how closely does functional connectivity correspond to synaptic connectivity?

suppose I define a random function that takes spike data as input and produces a random output, what is the (non-invertible) mapping?

Betsy: "Conclusion: we should be skeptical of our results."
Ryan: "Oh. You should always be skeptical about everything."


## Foundational

Neurotransmitters (frog heart)
H&H
Muscle Activation

### Theory

Hebbian Learning
    - how do cell assemblies wire into this structure - "fire together, write together"

#### Influential (don't know yet if they are right)

* Attractor models (stable states, represent behavioural variables, memories..)
    - Feboda lab, just on the edge of being possible to validate.
    - Hoppfield
    - pertubations (through optogenetics, microstimulation -> may hammer it off the manifold entirely)

* Experimental observations that spawn new areas of research
   - e.g. Hippocampal place cells (encode high level cognitive variables. just because they encode it doesn't mean that's their job)
   - influential in terms of sparking a lot of research

* Wolfram Shultz (dopamine)
    - trumpf of computational neuroscience (dopamine encoding predicion error?.. this is not the whole story.)
        - found a signal in the brain that looked much like the temporal learning from ML. last in a sequence 

no free lunch theorem

De Carlo
- trained on image recognition task.
- run stimuli through the network
- compare activations in layers with those of a monkey activations.
- feature detectors of ANN for lines, edges, similar to those seen in the monkey.

Aldshousen and Fields
- sparse coding in V1
- took images, ran through linear coder.
- combination of reconstruction error term and penalty (of activation of many neurons => have it be sparse)
- looks like V1, oriented gaubor patches
- what if V1 activation looks the way they do because of the objective function (sparse coding).

Marr's level of explanation
    - mindful of what level you are operating at


* Which would be the most groundbreaking finding in the future?
* What experiments would you run (with unconstrainted resources)?
- Where is the bottleneck?
    + Resources
    + Ideas?

If we had that data (any data you want), what would you do with it?
- what analysis method would you want?
    "Functional connectivity for sure!"
