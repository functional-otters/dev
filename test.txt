TODO:
- Pre-processs dataset: PSTH (10 ms) for all trials and neurons
- PCA: visualize (Heatmap) (a.k.a. PCA practice)
- Linear-nonlinear Poisson GLM
- Cross-correlation
- Methods from other papers?
   * Granger causality (natural to apply in a GLM framework).
   * Transfer entropy (measure of dependence over time).

% Compare against spike-time cross-correlation. (time lagged, correlation between two spike trains after you shift them in time against one another).
