estimate instantaneous firing rate:
	kernel smooth (convolve with Gaussian, rectangular window)
	- half-Gaussian, (causal filter does not go into the future)
        - trade-offs narrow/wide kernel.

concatinating trials.
    -> final output cross-correlation function.

time lag should go up with distance.
- common inputs
- number of synaptic hops
euclidian distance, correct proxy for signal distance to propagate in the brain? fibre tracks that curve around.

tests for cross-correlation function, for statistical validity.

spurious correlations,
    - when you can't distinguish from zero correlation. occationally, spike may like up by chance.
    - if these two neurons were truly not connected, what would their correlation look like? look at quantiles of correlation.
    - real cross-correlation functions from data. overlay estimates from NULL-distribution. how high and how low can it go in 95% of the cases. if it is higher than 95% => significant. between 5%-95%, indistinguishable.

model for correlation based on poisson.
    - what if the neurons in the brain are not poisson?

## Validation

statistical criterion for determining if the result is significant.

re-sampling test (preserve as much structure as you can, preservers autocorrelation, but destroys crosscorrelation).
    - randomly circularly-permute in time, destroy any temporal 
shuffle 1 second chunks randomly.
    - run 10k times for each pair of cells.
    - calculate a set of intervals, so that no permuted cross correlation value goes outside of the interval more than 5% of the time.

## Cross-correlation

persons correlation.

normalize by subtracting mean first.

normalize by std within windows

transform each vector into Z-scores.

estimate firing rates first.

centred normalized version: should go below zero.

###

for each time lag, calcualte the error bars.

### todo

average across trials.
